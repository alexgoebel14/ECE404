Smartphone devices from the likes of Google, LG, OnePlus, Samsung and Xiaomi are in danger of compromise by cyber criminals after 400 vulnerable code sections were uncovered on Qualcomm's Snapdragon digital signal processor (DSP) chip, which runs on over 40% of the global Android estate. The vulnerabilities were uncovered by Check Point, which said that to exploit the vulnerabilities, a malicious actor would merely need to convince their target to install a simple, benign application with no permissions at all.The vulnerabilities leave affected smartphones at risk of being taken over and used to spy on and track their users, having malware and other malicious code installed and hidden, and even being bricked outright, said Yaniv Balmas, Check Point's head of cyber research. Although they have been responsibly disclosed to Qualcomm, which has acknowledged them, informed the relevant suppliers and issued a number of alerts - CVE-2020-11201, CVE-2020-11202, CVE-2020-11206, CVE-2020-11207, CVE-2020-11208 and CVE-2020-11209 - Balmas warned that the sheer scale of the problem could take months or even years to fix.
