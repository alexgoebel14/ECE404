The BitVector.py module is for a memory-efficient packed
representation of bit vectors and for the processing of such
vectors.

If you wish, you can execute the code in

     BitVector.py

directly in this directory prior to the installation of the
module.  This will execute all of the example code in the
module file.

To see a working examples of the BitVector module, see 
the file

     Examples/BitVectorDemo.py

If there are any questions about this module, contact the
author at 'kak@purdue.edu' with the string 'bitvector' in
the subject line to get past his spam filter.
